# LT_Ruby_Appium
Sample repo to run app automation on real device on LambdaTest.

## Pre-requisites

- Install **Ruby** and **gem** on your local system. Follow these instructions to install on different operating systems.

  - For **Windows**, you can download from the [official website](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/).
  - For **Linux** or **Ubuntu**, you can run a simple apt command like below:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install ruby-full
    ```

  - For **macOS**, you can run a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) command like this:

    ```bash
    brew install ruby
    ```

- Ensure you have Dependency manager **bundler** installed. If not installed, you can install with the following command -

  ```bash
  gem install bundler
  ```

### Clone The Sample Project

**Step-1:** Clone the LambdaTestâ€™s [LT_Ruby_Appium](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT_Ruby_Appium) and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT_Ruby_Appium
cd LT_Ruby_Appium
```

### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest. To obtain your access credentials, [purchase a plan](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/plans) or access the [Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/).

**Step-2:** Set LambdaTest `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.

```bash
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```

### Upload Your Application

**Step-3:** Upload your **_iOS_** application (.ipa file) or **_android_** application (.apk file) to the LambdaTest servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

For Linux / MacOS:

```bash
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME":"YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"' 
```
For Windows:

```bash
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME":"YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk""
```
> Note:
> - If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on LambdaTest by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).
> - Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - <lt://APP123456789123456789> and will be used in the next step.

### Executing The Tests

If you are using an **iOS** app, the cURL command will generate an app URL for the corresponding iOS app and install the same for running the tests. You can either use our sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa) or upload your own app as discussed earlier.

**Step-4:** Navigate to the corresponding directory based on your app.

 - For android:
    ```bash
    cd android
    ```
- For ios:
  ```bash
  cd ios
  ```

**Step-5:** Execute the following command to run your test on LambdaTest platform:

```bash
bundle exec rake first
```
